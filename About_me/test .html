 <h2>ABOUT_ME</h2>

<P>
    I'm Ajibade Khadijat Aderonke as known as Kharon Apparel, a graduate of LAUTECH from the department of Crop and Environmental Protection. Am into web development, frontend to be precise.

    I began my tech journey some weeks ago, it has not been easy as newbie in tech as i've been facing different kinds of challenges in the program. 

    Alongside my academic and tech journey, am a fashion designer,i deals with unisex wears for both adult and children.

    I can't wait to learn and grow excellently in both field and use it to serve peoples in halal ways.

    <BR>MAY ALLAH MAKE IT EASY</BR>
